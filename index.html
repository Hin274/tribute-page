      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          These games featured the new region, Johto.
          They take place three years after the events of Pokémon Red and Blue.</li>
        <li>A hundred new Pokémon were introduced in the games. (101 if counting Celebi and including Mew)</li>
        <li>A time system was introduced, allowing certain Pokémon to appear at certain times, and events to occur on certain days.</li>
        <li>Pokémon could now hold items.
          A new item, PokéGear, allows the usage of a clock, cell/mobile phone, and radio.</li>
        <li>Specialized Poké Balls were introduced, allowing easier catching for specific types of Pokémon.</li>
        <li>Two new types of Pokémon were introduced, Dark-type and Steel-type Pokémon.</li>
        <li>The battle screen now shows how much experience the player's Pokémon has gained, and also whether a wild Pokémon has been caught or not.</li>
        <li>The ability to breed Pokémon was introduced.
        <li>A virus called "Pokérus", which infects a Pokémon allowing its experience to double, was first found.</li>
        <li>Shiny Pokémon debuted in these games.</li>
        <li>Backward connectivity was introduced, allowing trades with previous games.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Why do I like this game?</h2>
      <p>Nintendo has released so far eight generations of the Pokemon series as well as countless remakes and spinoffs. But what makes this game better than the others.
      </p>
      <h3>16 gym leaders to battle</h3>
      <p>Traditionally with other titles you faced 8 gym leaders only. Therefore this makes it the longest Pokemon game you would play considering nowadays you would pay for additional downloadable content. Thus this also makes the game incredible value for money</p>
      <h3>Time system</h3>
      <p>A feature that's only available in this title. Where certain Pokemon may only appear during the day and night as well only on a particular day in the week, which makes catching Pokemon interesting since you have to plan when to catch the pokemon you want.</p>
